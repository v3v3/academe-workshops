# Human vs Nature - The Global Politics of Climate Change



### Introduction

Climate change has become a popular term in public consciousness. Terms such as carbon-neutrality, net-zero emissions, global warming, extreme weather conditions, have penetrated news reporting, policymaking, and international meetings. Scientists from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warn that if humans do not take immediate action to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, we will face catastrophic consequences, like heatwaves, floods, wildfires, hurricanes, and as a result, disruptions in the business supply chain, which constitutes the material conditions of our everyday life.

To ensure such catastrophic consequences do not occur, the international community, the United Nations, national governments, cities, transnational businesses have come together to set a goal to limit carbon dioxide emissions, as they see carbon concentration in the atmosphere as the single most important drivers of the global rise of temperature. 

To arrive at this goal, politics is at play. Who should be responsible? Who needs to cut down emissions? What about economic development? Do rich countries have historical privilege on achieving net-zero targets? How will climate policies affect livelihoods, migration, global economics, political ideologies, national security, and so on? And, most importantly, are we, as human beings, divided into nations, companies, identities, and religions, able to solve the crisis of climate change, which will affect all of us?

- The overwhelming assumption of deterring climate change is that human beings should continue our way of life: electricity, globally linked production and consumption, travel. In order to maintain our lifestyle, which is very energy intensive, we need to reduce climate volatility. And to do this, we need to first reduce carbon dioxide emissions, and then *hopefully* capture more carbon dioxide to bring down carbon concentration in our atmosphere.

**Why is carbon dioxide so important?**

- Research shows that carbon dioxide is the most important at regulating Earth's atmospheric temperature (see the Research section). A higher concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere results in what is called a "greenhouse effect," where energy emitted by the sun gets trapped within the Earth's atmosphere. Carbon dioxide is able to trap energy due to its molecular structure and its ability to absorb and release infrared energy, and some of this infrared energy is released back to Earth, while others go to outer space. Carbon dioxide is not the only greenhouse gas, but the one which humans have released into the atmosphere most significantly, through the burning of fossil fuels. Without human intervention, carbon within the fossil fuels might stay beneath Earth's surface for a long time, but our explosive utilization of fossil fuels in a very short period of time (in Earth's time) have released a large quantity of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, the magnitude of which has not been seen in the observable carbon cycle in Earth's history.

**Then, what do we do about carbon dioxide?**

- The overall consensus in the global community is to achieve "carbon neutrality," which means to release as much as carbon dioxide as we absorb it. The aim of carbon neutrality is to make sure carbon concentration does not go up, so that we do not *worsen* the effects of climate change. This also means, some of the extreme weather conditions, like drought and flooding, that have newly manifested in recent years are probably here to stay. After we achieve carbon neutrality, we will find ways to bring down carbon concentration in the atmosphere through carbon capture, either naturally or technologically, in hopes of bringing global temperatures down to a more habitable level.
- Now, how do we achieve carbon neutrality as a globe? Here is where the politics come in.
  - Which countries are responsible for the high carbon concentration in the atmosphere? Are countries who historically released carbon dioxide also responsible? How do we calculate carbon responsibility? Who is to calculate?
  - What energy sources are preferred? Most of our energy sources come from fossil fuels currently, therefore we need to have a drastic transformation of how we use energy. What energy? How do we justify which energy is better? Biofuel? Wind, solar, and hydro can be very volatile, which means unreliable electricity generation.
  - What about economic development? Can there be economic growth with net-zero emissions? Some developed country has demonstrated that it's possible, but is it so for developing countries?
  - The effects of climate change means migration. How will a planet divided into nations handle climate refugees?
  - Another effect of climate change is increasingly scarce resources, like fresh water, and how will humans handle this? Is war inevitable?
  - What roles do technology play? Are they over-emphasized? Are they deployed for the benefit of technocrats? Can humans maintain our energy-intensive lifestyle with less carbon emissions?
  - Who is threatened? The effects of climate change is uneven across the globe. Will this result in a reshaping of world politics? Who will suffer as a consequence?
  - Are we serious about our planet, or do we simply want to maintain our way of life as long as necessary? Do we care about nature?



### Potential Topics

**Carbon accounting**

> How to account for carbon, in both corporate and national categories, influence how the public and policymakers will enact societal change.



**Market vs nature**

> Is a market methodology appropriate for climate change crisis?



**Fragmentation**

> Does the prioritization of carbon emissions prevent a holistic change in society: deforestation, business supply chain, etc.



**Borrowed time**

> Pledges. Credits. The process of nature's adjustment takes time. We have used time (the formation of fossil fuels) for technological progress. Is there temporal debt?



**Geopolitics**

> The first-world vs third-world development debate. Who should pay? How can there be genuine cooperation? Is development such an important national and economic priority?



**Technological determinism**

> Can technology single-handedly solve the climate crisis?



### Key Concepts

**Nationally determined contributions (NDC)**



**Negative emissions**



**GHG**

> Abbreviation for Greenhouse Gas.



**CDR**

> Carbon dioxide removal.



**GHG scope 3 emissions**

>The GHG Protocol Corporate Standard classifies a company’s GHG emissions into three ‘scopes’.  Scope 1 emissions are direct emissions from owned or controlled sources.  Scope 2 emissions are indirect emissions from the generation of purchased energy.  Scope 3 emissions are all indirect emissions (not included in scope 2) that occur in the value chain of the reporting company, including both upstream and downstream emissions.

**Production-based accounting (PBA)**



**Consumption-based accounting (CBA)**



**Carbon Leakage**

> Countries around the world have varying greenhouse gas emissions policies to help limit climate change, with some stricter than others. Carbon leakage refers to a situation where a company decides to move their production from a country with stringent policies, to a country that is more lenient, leading to an increase in greenhouse gas emissions.

**Cap and Trade (or emissions trading systems, i.e. ETS)**

> Cap and trade is an approach that harnesses market forces to reduce emissions cost-effectively. Like other market-based strategies, it  differs from “command-and-control” approaches where the government sets  performance standards or dictates technology choices for individual  facilities. Cap and trade allows the market to determine a price on  carbon, and that price drives investment decisions and spurs market  innovation.

**Certified B Corporation**

> Certified B Corporations are a new kind of business that balances  purpose and profit. They are legally required to consider the impact of  their decisions on their workers, customers, suppliers, community, and  the environment. This is a community of leaders, driving a global  movement of people using business as a force for good.

**Temperature anomaly**

> A temperature anomaly is the departure from the average  temperature, positive or negative, over a certain period. In standard  usage, the normal average temperature would be calculated over a period  of at least 30 years over an homogeneous geographic region. 
>
> [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature_anomaly)



**Carbon cycle**

> The carbon cycle describes the process in which carbon atoms continually travel from the atmosphere to the Earth and then back into the  atmosphere. Since our planet and its atmosphere form a closed  environment, the amount of carbon in this system does not change. Where  the carbon is located — in the atmosphere or on Earth — is constantly in flux.

**Blue bonds**

> Blue Bonds fund **commitments towards oceans, water related initiatives and sustainability**. When a company issues a blue bond, it specifically commits to investing the proceeds on business solutions for oceanic health, freshwater and/or to improve access to water and sanitation.

**Net-zero emissions**

> Net-zero emissions will be achieved when all GHG emissions released by humans are counterbalanced by [removing GHGs from the atmosphere](https://wriorg.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/foundational-questions-carbon-removal-united-states.pdf) in a process known as carbon removal.
>
> First and foremost, human-caused emissions (such as those from  fossil-fueled vehicles and factories) should be reduced as close to zero as possible. Any remaining GHGs should then be balanced with an  equivalent amount of [carbon removal,](https://wriorg.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/foundational-questions-carbon-removal-united-states.pdf) which can happen through things like restoring forests or using [direct air capture and storage](https://www.wri.org/publication/tech-carbon-removal-usa) (DACS) technology. Reaching net-zero emissions is akin to achieving "climate neutrality."

**Milankovitch cycles**

> **Milankovitch cycles** describe the collective effects of changes in the [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth)'s movements on its [climate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate) over thousands of years. The term is named for [Serbian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia) [geophysicist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysics) and [astronomer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomer) [Milutin Milanković](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milutin_Milanković). In the 1920s, he hypothesized that variations in [eccentricity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eccentricity_(orbit)), [axial tilt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axial_tilt), and [precession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precession) resulted in cyclical variation in the [solar radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_radiation) reaching the Earth, and that this [orbital forcing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_forcing) strongly influenced the Earth's climatic patterns.
