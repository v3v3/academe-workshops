# The Value of Life: The Economy of Oppression and Depression

Reference reading for discussion: [The Anatomy of an AI System](https://anatomyof.ai).

### Introduction

There is a story of a Japanese man who offered his presence as a service. He said he would not do anything, say anything, but would only be there to accompany whoever requires his presence. Then, he would get paid for this service. It turned out, his service was quite popular, and many people paid him to just "be there." In this process, he accompanied people from all walks of life in their myriad activities. Loneliness is wide-spread, therefore accompaniment becomes valuable.

As long as there are people willing to buy, there will be people willing to sell. In an ever-increasingly market-driven society, everything seems to have a price. We put values on work, on time, on pieces of paper, series of words, and collection of images. We then buy and sell. Our life is in the marketplace. And so it seems only a natural consequence that we have put a value on the life of human beings. What is the consequence of marketing life itself? When value is the foundation of our human relationships, what happens to our psychology? In the market, there is always comparison. The more and the less. The superior and the inferior. And what is the relation between comparison and oppression, power, and tyranny? Is assigning value, and therefore comparison, the cause of our act of killing, war, and control? And how is this process of comparison related to our psychological expression, such as depression, anxiety, fear, and loneliness?
